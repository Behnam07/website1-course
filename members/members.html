                        <p class="member-bio">Philip wrote the randomisation of scenarios in each
                            different room, this allowed for a different experience every time you went to a
                            room. Also most of the boilerplate code that the game runs on. Philip wrote some
                            sections of the story to develop the story line by adding scenarios in rooms he
                            was assigned to by the team manager.

                        <p class="member-bio">Yasmin managed all of the trello boards and kept everyone
                            in track of what they needed to do. Yasmin came up with different
                            hazards/scenarios which we could use within the game to make each room different
                            and that the user would have to deal with carefully. Yasmin also wrote and
                            thought of most of the story, She is a good friend for us.

                        <p class="member-bio">Kamrul wrote most of the story and dialogue allowing for
                            the other team members being able to write other important code for the game.
                            Kamrul wrote most of the hazards/scenarios within the game, allowing for a
                            fluent development of the story and allowing to fill the game with decisions for
                            the user to make throughout the adventure.
